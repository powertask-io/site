  What Powertask does for you, and when to use it.  
---

## What is it?

Powertask is a Java library to let automated processes interact with humans through Slack. It integrates with the [Camunda BPM Platform](https://camunda.com).

With Camunda and Powertask, you can:

* Automate business processes, ranging from simple approval processes with buttons in a Slack message, to complex dynamic interactions through Slack Modals.
* Build Slack bots that are powered by smart processes.  

## Why do I want it?

Because you want to build your processes with Camunda's best-in-the-world process engine, but you want extremely convenient interfaces and interactions for your colleagues or customers. 

## Where should I go next?

Give your users next steps from the Overview. For example:
